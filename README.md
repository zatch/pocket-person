# Pocket Person
Pocket Person is a Tamagotchi-style game where you grow adult humans into even larger adult humans. If you don't take care of these adults, they will die. Think about that.

The game was developed for my Ludum Dare 34 entry. The theme for LD34 was tied between "growing" and "two button control" and I incorporated both. You can blame the jerks who voted for "two button control" for the terrible menu navigation.

Pocket Person was developed using (Phaser 2.4.4)[https://github.com/photonstorm/phaser/tree/v2.4.4] and (RequireJS)[https://github.com/jrburke/requirejs]
